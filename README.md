**How It's Made:**
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This is a fun project that I got a chance to put together. This project is crafted with the tech mentioned above. Through NASA integration I'm able to bring you real-time Mars rover photos. taken by the Curiosity Rover. Choose a date and unveil the magic this Red Planet has to offer.

**Optimizations**

One way that I would like to optimize this project is by adding another API integration that shares fun facts about Mars and space. Space is fascinating and it would make the project a bit more fun. 

**Lessons Learned:**

Despite being a fun project, this was also a challenging one. My main challenge came when figuring out how to shuffle through the photos that were taken...randomly. It was not an easy task and took some time to figure out. Although it's a bit of a complex concept for me still, I learned about the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm which allowed me to bring to life what I imagined for the project.
